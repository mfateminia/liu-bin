        "content": "Unlike conventional fluorophores which usually exhibit quenched emission at high concentration or in aggregate state, fluorogens with aggregation-induced emission (AIE) characteristics show exactly the opposite phenomenon. Typical AIE fluorogens are characterized by their propeller-shaped rotorlike structures, which undergo low-frequency torsional motions as isolated molecules and emit very weakly in solutions. Our research focuses on two approaches to utilize AIE effect in the development of fluorescent bioprobes. On the one hand, these fluorogens can be engineered",
